Files for Practical Machine Learning project.

This repo contains the final report. The HTML report can be more easily viewed
at https://github.io/icgordon/pml/pml.html

Even though the Rmd file was pushed to that location, I am not sure how it can be
viewed there. So both the HTML and Rmd files are available in this repo.
